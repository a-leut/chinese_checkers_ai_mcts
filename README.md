## About

This is an artificial intelligence agent developed to play Chinese Checkers. In a simulated tournament of fifteen programs this program placed in third. I cannot say how this program would do against an expert human player, but I would be interested to know.

I chose to use a [Monte-Carlo Tree Search](http://mcts.ai/about/index.html) based agent with domain specific modifications for Chinese Checkers to encourage good lines of play. My approach was influenced by two artificial intelligence papers with similiar techniques. 

From Nijssen's paper, I took a selection function that is an extension of UCB1 with the addition of a progressive bias.

I also changed the tree expansion and simulation playout policy based Sturtevantâ€™s experience. Instead of expanding every node that is reached during selection, a node will only be expanded if it has previously been reached a fixed number times and is a forward move across the board. During simulation the program will only consider forward moves.

## Building / Running

You will need "GameMaster.jar" and a binary of "ChineseCheckersModerator." I have included GameMaster.jar and a Windows executable of the moderator program. See [this repo](https://github.com/wtmitchell/tradgames) to build these programs from source.

1. Export runable jar of project
2. Run GameMaster program
3. Select jar of my program as Player1 or Player2
4. Select "Human" for other player
5. Select "ChineseCheckersModerator" program for moderator
6. Begin game
